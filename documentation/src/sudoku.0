       _S_u_d_o_k_u  is  a  FLTK‐based  version of the game of Sudoku.  Sudoku (pro‐
       nounced soo‐dough‐coo with the emphasis on the  first  syllable)  is  a
       simple  number‐based  puzzle/game  played on a 9x9 grid that is divided
       into 3x3 subgrids. The goal is to enter a number from 1 to  9  in  each
       cell so that each number appears only once in each column and row.

       At the start of a new game, Sudoku fills in a random selection of cells
       for you ‐ the number of cells depends on the difficulty level you  use.
       Click  in  any  of  the  empty cells or use the arrow keys to highlight
       individual cells and press a number from 1 to 9 to fill in the cell. To
       clear  a cell, press 0, Delete, or Backspace. As you complete each sub‐
       grid, correct subgrids are highlighted in green. When you have success‐
       fully  completed  all  subgrids, the entire puzzle is highlighted until
       you start a new game.

       As you work to complete the puzzle, you can display possible  solutions
       inside  each  cell by holding the Shift key and pressing each number in
       turn. Repeat the process to remove individual numbers, or press a  num‐
       ber  without  the  Shift  key to replace them with the actual number to
       use.
