       checkers − the fltk checkers game


SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       _C_h_e_c_k_e_r_s  is a FLTK‐based version of the game of checkers.  The game is
       played on an 8x8 board with each player  starting  with  12  pieces  or
       "checkers" on opposite sides of the board. The computer plays the white
       checkers in this version of the game.

       The object of the game is to  remove  all  of  your  opponents  pieces.
       Players  move  one  of  their  pieces  diagonally forward on each move,
       either a single space or by "jumping" an adjacent piece. Your opponents
       pieces  are  removed by jumping them ‐ you can make multiple jumps in a
       single turn.

       If a piece reaches the other side of the board, it is  converted  to  a
       "king" which can move both forwards and backwards.
